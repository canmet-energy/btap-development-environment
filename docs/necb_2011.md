# National Energy Code for Buildings 2011 Model Generation Simulation and testing.
Natural Resources Canada has implemented NECB prototype buildings withing the OpenStudio framework. To generate and run these models there are currently many ways to accomplish this.
* Use a bash script
* Use measure in an OpenStudio Server spreadsheet
* Use the measure in the OpenStudio Model editor

## Bash script method
The easiest way to generate and optionally run the models is to use a bash script. The bash script is already installed and configured in your docker container workspace that you created in the docker setup. What you first must do is ensure that your openstudio-standards gem is up to date. You can do this by running this command to do just that. This will take a few minutes to complete. This is good to do every once and a while to ensure you have the latest from NREL and NRCan.  
```bash
btap_gem_update_standards.sh
```
Now Simply start the workspace and type the following at the Terminator terminal. This will provide context on how to run a single, multiple, or all combinations of weather and climate files. This will take some time to complete.
*Note: this may take a lot of disk space, so I would recommend for large runs you use your windows-host folder this folder is not limited by the container's size, but rather your C drive.*  
```bash
btap_necb_arch --help
``
Once the simulations are complete, you may review them from the output folder.
